# Computer-Vision

This is my repository to learn computer vision with python, thanks to Adrian Rosebrock for providing the tutorials at pyimagesearch.

I will begin wtih basic OpenCV techniques to manipulate images, 
then later develop my own neural network to run object and facial detection model.

This Repo will grow as I progress!
